## notes :

    Hi!

    I really enjoyed this task and hope my version can be approved.
    I've read the article that was pointed out in README.md about chain-of-responsibility approach.
    As I understood using this version we need to create seperated classes and use nodes (handlers).
    I will happily refactor my version when I will have the necessary skills.

    This version is 'kinda' using
    chain-of-responsibility approach as program.

    a. creates a list (chain) of employees that can
       authorize this amount. ( can be all, can be 1 )
    b. going through the list (chain) finds the employee
       with the lowest cost amount limit
       (so it's closest to the requested amount )
